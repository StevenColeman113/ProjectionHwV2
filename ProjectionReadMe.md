# This serves to show the standard view of the US on a Map with the rivers labeled to show the affects other maps will have on distortion.

# This map is using a cylindrical projection, as we can see many of the rivers end up appearing more compressed when compared to that of the previous map. The direction is still conserved.

# This map uses the Azimuthal projection, it projects from a top down view but heavily distorts direction, distance isn't distorted too much.

# This last map uses a conic projection. As we can see things tend to get distorted towards the poles and it is very visible in the top of our map as alaska takes on an unrealistic curve. This would lead to someone reading this map to think that the rivers follow more of a curve than they truly do.
